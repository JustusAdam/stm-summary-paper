\begin{abstract}
  Software Transactional Memory is widely known to be a safe and easy but also
  slow abtraction for writing concurrent programs. Some go so far as to call
  it a ``research toy''\cite{research-toy}.

  In truth STM really has not seen much adoption by the mainstream, with one
  exception. Haskell, the most popular functional programming language, supports
  STM and here it has seen widespread use by major projects and frameworks.

  In this work I explore why STM integrates well into the Haskell ecosystem and
  how some of the common issues when using STM are remedied by Haskells powerful
  type system and design patterns.
