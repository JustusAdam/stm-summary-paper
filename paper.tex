\begin{abstract}
  Software Transactional Memory is a safe and easy abtraction for writing
  concurrent programs. But it also has some shortcomings, mainly that it is
  slow. Some go so far as to call it a ``research toy''\cite{research-toy}.

  In truth STM has seen very little adoption by the mainstream, despite two
  decades of research. But, there is an exception. Haskell, is an industry
  strength functional programming language and supports STM. Many of the major
  projects and frameworks written in Haskell use STM directly and some of the
  most used support libraries use it internally.

  In this work I explore why STM integrates well into the Haskell ecosystem and
  how some of the common issues when using STM are remedied by Haskells powerful
  type system and design patterns.
