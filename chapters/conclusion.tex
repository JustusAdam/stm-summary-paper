\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:conclusion}

Languages such as Haskell are a better fit for the use of STM. Some of the
common problems with STM do not occur in Haskell. Immutable data and explicit
memory manipulation remove the need for complicated privatization and overly
conservative protection. Furthermore side effects in transactions are
categorically forbidden via the type system.

STM does not solve the concurrency problem completely. Even in Haskell there are
other primitives available, such as message passing and a lock-like
data structure. Both of which are also widely used. However STM is perhaps
currently the safest, easiest and most reliable system to express computations
with complex invariants.
